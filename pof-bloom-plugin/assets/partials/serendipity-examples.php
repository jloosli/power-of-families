<h2>Examples of Serendipity Moments</h2>
<p>Your child isn't feeling very well and is laying on the couch watching cartoons. You're trying to get ready for a
    birthday party and your sick child keeps asking for little things and complaining. You decide to take a break from
    what you're doing to sit on the couch, hold her on your lap and just snuggle with her for five minutes.</p>
<p>One of your kids notices there's a beautiful sunset outside and points it out to you. You gather all the family
    members and watch it together, each person pointing out their favorite colors. Everyone puts their arms around
    each other.</p>
<p>It's a beautiful day. You've got lots to do and you're feeling frazzled but when your son says he wants to go ride
    his bike, you say, "Hey, let's all go for a little bike ride!" You take a 1/2 hour to go on a nice little bike ride
    and come back feeling energized and ready to finish your task list and your kids are all happy and better able to
    entertain themselves since they got their wiggles out on the ride.</p>
<p>While you work on an email, your son asks you a question. You ask him to wait a minute. He comes and asks for
    something else. You again ask him to wait. He comes in again. You decide to close the computer and really listen
    to what he's saying and fully answer his question. You take him on your lap and follow his interests and snuggle
    him. You end up having a lovely little moment together.</p>
<p>Your baby won't go to sleep for her nap and you're pretty frustrated. She wants you to stay in her room with her
    but you've got so much to do! You bring a book into her room, lay down on the floor and get some nice reading done
    while she falls asleep with the calming satisfaction of having you nearby - and you get a bonus chance to read.</p>
<p>You husband calls from work to say he'll be late. You haven't been able to eat together as a family for a long time.
    You decide to load up the kids, grab some a picnic or some take-out and take dinner to him.</p>
<p>Thoughts of a certain friend keep popping into your mind. You decide to call your friend. It ends up being a great
    chance to catch up and you both leave the phone call feeling re-energized about life.</p>
<p>It's been a busy week and you haven't had much family time. You decide to let the kids stay up late and play a
    game together. Everyone has a great time and they only get to bed 1/2 hour late.</p>
<p>It's a big hassle to get there, but you show up right on time for a program at the school for one of your children
    only to find out that you wrote down the wrong date in your planner - it's next week! You take your preschoolers
    to a nearby park they've been begging to try out and enjoy the "bonus" hour you have in your day.</p>
<p>You're doing your Saturday morning cleaning as a family but it's such a beautiful day outside and people are
    whining and complaining. You set the timer and challenge everyone to work fast and hard until it goes off then
    you all go play soccer in the backyard.</p>
